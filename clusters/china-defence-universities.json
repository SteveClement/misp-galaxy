The institute is the only university run by the CCP General Office, which manages administrative matters for the Central Committee. The General Office is usually run by one of the general secretary\u2019s most trusted aides. It oversees China\u2019s cryptographic and state secrets agency as well as security for the party\u2019s leadership.BESTI has a student population of around 2,000 and has strict admission requirements. Students at the university are scrutinized for their political beliefs, and are typically CCP or Communist Youth League members. The activities of their relatives are screened for political issues. Having no parents or siblings who worked abroad or were involved in \u2018illegal organisations\u2019 is a condition of enrolment. The institute claims to count 50 ministerial-level party officials among its 12,000 graduates.BESTI has a close relationship with Xidian University and Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications. The two universities are its primary collaborators on scientific papers. BESTI runs joint master\u2019s programs with Xidian University in cryptography, information and communication engineering, and computer applications technology. It also has joint doctoral programs with the University of Science and Technology of China and Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications in cybersecurity.The university runs the Key Laboratory of Information Security (\u4fe1\u606f\u5b89\u5168\u91cd\u70b9\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5ba4/\u4fe1\u606f\u5b89\u5168\u4e0e\u4fdd\u5bc6\u91cd\u70b9\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5ba4). Several websites claim that it runs a joint laboratory with the Chinese Academy of Sciences Institute of High Energy Physics, but this could not be confirmed.",

Notably, Mianyang is home to a military-civil fusion (MCF) demonstration base\u2014the Sichuan Mianyang High-Technology City. Sichuan Military District Commander Jiang Yongshen (\u59dc\u6c38\u7533) in 2016 stressed the important role that Mianyang plays in China\u2019s larger science and technology development and the significance of its military-civil fusion (MCF) demonstration base.The academy is best known for nuclear weapons, but also carries out research on directed-energy weapons. CAEP\u2019s four main tasks are to develop nuclear weapons, research microwaves and lasers for nuclear fusion ignition and directed-energy weapons, study technologies related to conventional weapons, and deepen military-civil fusion. It claims that its research covers 260 specialising, primarily in the broad areas of physics and mathematics, mechanics and engineering, materials and chemistry, electronics and information, and optics and electrical engineering.CAEP hosts part of the Tianhe-2 supercomputer, one of the worlds fastest supercomputers.Despite the sensitivity of its work, CAEP has expanded its international presence in recent years. It claims to send hundreds of scientists overseas to study or work as visiting scholars. CAEP has also used Chinese government talent recruitment schemes such as the Thousand Talents Plan to recruit dozens of scientists from abroad. By 2015, CAEP had recruited 57 scholars through the Thousand Talents Plan, making it one of the largest recruiters of Thousand Talents Plan scholars.CAEP maintains strong collaborative relationships with Chinese civilian universities. It runs a joint laboratory with the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China and collaborates with universities and research institutions including the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the University of Science and Technology of China, Shandong University, Southwest University of Science and Technology, Sichuan University, Jilin University, Peking University and Tsinghua University. CAEP sponsors postgraduate students in many of these institutions who are required to work there for five years after graduating.",

Numerous Chinese analysts have studied Boeing\u2019s conversion of the 737 into the P-8 Poseidon and E-7A surveillance aircraft and argue that the C919 could also be retrofitted for early warning as well as anti-surface and anti-submarine warfare missions.\u00a0With a greater flight range than China\u2019s other military aircraft, a retrofitted C919 for maritime surveillance operations could reduce China\u2019s dependence on artificial air bases in the South China Sea which currently render aircraft vulnerable to corrosion due to harsh weather conditions.\u00a0Vice-Chairman of the Central Military Commission, Zhang Youxia, reportedly expressed an interest in learning from American companies in converting civilian aircraft into military aircraft while inspecting COMAC\u2019s C919.

The university is a leading centre of research and training on shipbuilding, naval armaments, maritime technology and nuclear power. 36.46% of the university\u2019s 2017 graduates who found employment were working in the defence sector.As one of the group of universities subordinate to the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) known as the \u2018Seven Sons of National Defence\u2019 (\u56fd\u9632\u4e03\u5b50), HEU is an integral part of China\u2019s defence industry. HEU\u2019s achievements include producing China\u2019s first experimental submarine, ship-based computer, and hovercraft. The university claims to have participated in most of the PLA Navy\u2019s submarine, undersea weapon, and warship projects.HIT\u2019s role in the defence industry is highlighted by its formal affiliation with the PLA Navy, which became a supervising agency of the university in 2007. Under the supervisory agreement, the PLA Navy committed to developing HEU\u2019s capacity as a platform for research and development in military technology and for training defence personnel. The following year, HEU established a Defence Education Institute to train reserve officers. Since then, the institute has trained at least 1,700 officers. HEU also maintains a joint laboratory with the PLA Navy Coatings Analysis and Detection Center.HEU is an important hub research on nuclear engineering, including on nuclear submarines. In 2018, it signed a co-construction agreement with defence conglomerate China National Nuclear Corporation (CNNC). In 2019, HEU and CNNC established the China Nuclear Industry Safety and Simulation Technology Research Institute. HEU also runs a joint laboratory on energetic materials (such as explosives) with the Chinese Academy of Engineering Physics, China\u2019s nuclear warhead research organisation.\n",

PLA experts have described IEU as \u2018the sole military academy for the cyber and electronic warfare arms of China\u2019s network-electronic forces\u2019.The IEU is currently subordinate to the PLA Strategic Support Force\u2019s Network Systems Department, which holds the military\u2019s signals intelligence capabilities. Previously, the university was run by the General Staff Department Third Department (commonly known as 3PLA), the PLA\u2019s signals intelligence service that has been incorporated into the Strategic Support Force. IEU\u2019s command tracks include Network Engineering (\u7f51\u7edc\u5de5\u7a0b), which is dedicated to the cultivation of cyber attack and defense technical cadre (\u7f51\u7edc\u653b\u9632\u6280\u672f\u5e72\u90e8).\u00a0It is responsible for the construction of the Henan Provincial Laboratory of Visible Light Communication (\u6cb3\u5357\u7701\u53ef\u89c1\u5149\u901a\u4fe1\u91cd\u70b9\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5ba4).The university is primarily known for research and training on hacking, cryptography, signals processing, surveying and mapping, and navigation technology. However, since absorbing the PLA Foreign Languages University, it now serves as one of the most important language schools for Chinese military intelligence officers, describing itself as a \u2018whole-military foreign languages training base for individuals going abroad\u2019. While the PLA Foreign Languages University is best known for training signals intelligence officers, it has also trained many officers in the PLA\u2019s political warfare wing, the Central Military Commission Political Work Department Liaison Bureau.",

In 2017, SASTIND designated eight fields of research at JLU as national defence disciplines, indicating the university carries out high levels of defence research. \u00a0In 2012, JLU spent roughly RMB60 million (AUD12.5 million) on defence research, a number that is likely to have grown substantially.JLU\u2019s National Defense Science and Technology Research Institute, also known as the Advanced Technology Research Institute, was established in April 2006 and is responsible for the organization and management of the university\u2019s national defence science and technology projects. The research institute has received several certifications to conduct research for military applications. It conducts research in collaboration with the former PLA General Armaments Department, SASTIND, and state-owned defence conglomerates in the fields of aviation, aerospace, electronics, nuclear technology, and shipbuilding.JLU\u2019s State Key Laboratory of Superhard Materials (\u8d85\u786c\u6750\u6599\u56fd\u5bb6\u91cd\u70b9\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5ba4) works closely with China\u2019s nuclear weapons complex, the Chinese Academy of Engineering Physics (CAEP).

The university developed the Tianhe-2A supercomputer at the National Supercomputing Center in Guangzhou, the world\u2019s fastest supercomputer from 2013 to 2016. NUDT\u2019s Tianhe-1A supercomputer is based at Hunan University\u2019s National Supercomputing Center Changsha (\u56fd\u5bb6\u8d85\u7ea7\u8ba1\u7b97\u957f\u6c99\u4e2d\u5fc3).For over a decade, NUDT has aggressively leveraged overseas expertise and resources to build its capabilities. The Australian Strategic Policy Institute\u2019s International Cyber Policy Centre\u2019s October 2018 report \u2018Picking flowers, making honey: The Chinese military\u2019s collaboration with foreign universities\u2019 documented and analysed NUDT\u2019s overseas presence. The report found that by 2013 the university had sent over 1,600 of its professors and students to study and work abroad. Universities in the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, Singapore, the Netherlands and Germany engage in some of the highest levels of collaboration with NUDT. Some of NUDT\u2019s leading experts on drone swarms, hypersonic missiles, supercomputers, radars, navigation and quantum physics have been sent to study or work abroad.Defected Chinese spy Wang Liqiang claimed in 2019 that NUDT\u2019s \u2018Intelligence Center\u2019 sent him fake passports for his mission to interfere in Taiwanese politics. This indicates that the university plays an important role in supporting China\u2019s overseas intelligence activity.NUDT also works with foreign technology companies. Google and Microsoft have both worked with and trained NUDT scientists.",

            "description": "PKU is considered among China\u2019s most prestigious universities with a storied history. It is ranked as one of China\u2019s top two academic institutions, along with Tsinghua University. Unsurprisingly, the university has been included in a number of the PRC\u2019s educational initiatives, including as a Class A institution under the Double First-Class University program.PKU has been subject to at least two joint-supervision agreements between the Ministry of Education and defence industry agency SASTIND. These agreements, signed in 2012 and 2016, are designed to deepen the university\u2019s involvement in defence research.PKU\u2019s Advanced Technology Institute was founded in 2006 to oversee and develop the university\u2019s defence research. Includes several research centres and supervises the university\u2019s four major defence laboratories. The institute\u2019s research covers semiconductors, nuclear technology, quantum physics, advanced materials, underwater acoustics, satellite navigation and communications, flight propulsion, aerospace engineering and microprocessors.In 2017, PKU and the Chinese Academy of Engineering Physics (CAEP)\u2014China\u2019s nuclear weapons program\u2014established the PKU\u2013CAEP New Structure Center for Applied Physics and Technology (\u5317\u4eac\u5927\u5b66-\u4e2d\u56fd\u5de5\u7a0b\u7269\u7406\u7814\u7a76\u9662\u65b0\u4f53\u5236\u5e94\u7528\u7269\u7406\u4e0e\u6280\u672f\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u5fc3).. The institution was founded on the basis of the PKU Center for Applied Physics and Technology (\u5317\u4eac\u5927\u5b66\u5e94\u7528\u7269\u7406\u4e0e\u6280\u672f\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u5fc3) established with CAEP in 2007. The joint centre carries out research on materials, lasers for atomic physics applications, laser plasma physics, computer science and fluid dynamics. PKU\u2019s report on the centre notes that it will serve China\u2019s national defence needs and that CAEP\u2019s deputy director emphasised it should \u2018take the path of military-civil fusion\u2019. The joint centre\u2019s honorary director and founding director, He Xiantu, is credited as the developer of China\u2019s first neutron bomb.PKU takes precautions for the protection of classified information. The university has an office devoted to the secure handling of classified information, hosting regular meetings and training sessions to strengthen the university\u2019s security culture. In 2006, the university received security credentials for participation in classified defence research.",

For instance, the university signed an agreement with Chinese video surveillance equipment manufacturer Hikvision in 2016 to set up a joint laboratory on video image recognition technology. In 2018, it signed a strategic cooperation agreement with Xiamen Meiya Pico Information Co., a Chinese company that provides digital forensics and information security products, which included upgrading a forensics laboratory and establishing a cyber security attack and defence laboratory.The university also has cooperation agreements with numerous local government-level public security bureaus across the PRC. These include agreements on image recognition technology for local public security bureaus and joint laboratories. For instance, in 2018 alongside the Nanshan sub-bureau of Shenzhen Public Security Bureau and the artificial intelligence companies SenseTime and Shenzhen Yuantian Lifei, it signed a strategic cooperation agreement on applying video recognition and the establishment of a joint laboratory.",

That figure has almost certainly grown since 2016, when SEU came under a \u2018joint construction\u2019 agreement between the Ministry of Education and defence industry agency SASTIND. The university has secret security credentials, enabling it to participate in secret defence projects.The university has also been linked to cyberespionage. Researchers at its School of Cyber Science and Engineering (\u7f51\u7edc\u7a7a\u95f4\u5b89\u5168\u5b66\u9662) have been funded by the MSS, China\u2019s civilian intelligence agency. The School of Cyber Science and Engineering has close ties to TopSec, a Chinese information security company that trains, recruits and works with PLA cyber security officers.SEU states that its defence research relies on its excellence in electronics. It has at least two laboratories that specialise in defence research on navigation technology and underwater acoustics. Both laboratories may be involved in developing technology for underwater warfare. Representatives from the PLA Navy\u2019s Submarine Academy visited SEU in 2017.SEU has also built relationships with state-owned defence conglomerates. In 2017, the university signed a strategic cooperation agreement with missile-manufacturer China Aerospace Science and Industry Corporation. In 2018 and 2019, it signed similar agreements with subsidiaries of China Electronics Technology Group Corporation, China\u2019s leading manufacturer of military electronics.",

Often characterized as \u2018China\u2019s MIT,\u2019 Tsinghua is highly ranked globally, while also being the alma mater of numerous Chinese leaders, including Xi Jinping. Tsinghua has been included in numerous Chinese educational initiatives, including acting as a Class A institution in the Double First-Class University Plan and with membership in China\u2019s C9 League. As of spring 2018, Tsinghua University had 390 research institutions operating across a range of fields.Tsinghua engages in a range of military research and was awarded secret-level security credentials for classified research in 2007. In advancing military-civil fusion, Tsinghua also continues its \u2018fine tradition\u2019 of serving China\u2019s national security and defense, actively creating new platforms and initiatives to support this strategy. Not only its dedicated defence laboratories but also a range of key laboratories and research institutions at the university have received funding from the military. Since at least 2012, Tsinghua has also been jointly supervised by defence industry agency SASTIND as part of a program to deepen its defence research and links to the defence sector.Tsinghua\u2019s defence research covers areas such as artificial intelligence, air-to-air missiles, navigation technology, instrument science and materials science.The university trains students for China\u2019s nuclear weapons program, military and defence industry. In 2014 it signed a strategic cooperation agreement with the Chinese Academy of Engineering Physics (CAEP)\u2014China\u2019s nuclear weapons program.\u00a0 In 2016, CAEP\u2019s Materials Institute and Tsinghua established a joint postgraduate training base for teaching, research collaboration and equipment sharing.Approximately 200 postgraduate students at Tsinghua are sponsored by CAEP or defence industry conglomerates each year through the Chinese government\u2019s National Defence Science and Technology Scholarship program. Scholarship recipients are required to work for their sponsoring organisation for five years after graduating. Roughly 2000 of the scholarships are awarded each year, indicating that Tsinghua students are among the primary recipients of them. Documents published by Tsinghua indicate that CAEP planned to sponsor 40 PhD students to study nuclear technology in 2013. CAEP continues to sponsor Tsinghua postgraduates. In 2004, Tsinghua agreed to supervise doctoral students from the PLA\u2019s Second Artillery Engineering University, now known as the Rocket Force University of Engineering.",

It is now subordinate to the Ministry of Education (MOE) and is also jointly supervised by defence industry agencies MIIT and SASTIND, as well as the Chinese military\u2019s leading electronics manufacturer, China Electronics Technology Group Corporation (CETC).The university is one of China\u2019s leading universities for defence electronics research. It claims to rank among the top MOE universities in terms of the scale of its defence research. Between 2011 and 2015, its annual spending on defence research grew by 210% to RMB400 million (AUD80 million) and may account for as much as 32% of its overall research spending. 16.43% of UESTC graduates in 2017 who found employment were working in the defence sector. UESTC gained secret-level security credentials about a decade ago, probably in 2006, making it one of the first MOE universities to hold them.UESTC research has been used by state-owned manufacturers of military aircraft, missiles, and military electronics and the PLA Navy on projects such as the JF-17 fighter and the Navy\u2019s aircraft carrier program.UESTC\u2019s defence research covers areas including electronics, microwaves, terahertz technology, anti-jamming technology and signal processing, communication systems, military-use critical materials, optoelectric imaging. Between 2001 and 2005, UESTC undertook over 900 military electronics projects worth in excess of RMB500 million (AUD104 million).UESTC\u2019s research on artificial intelligence has attracted scrutiny for its human rights implications. In 2015, a professor recruited by UESTC through the Thousand Talents Plan established a company called Koala AI. The company produces artificial intelligence surveillance systems that are used in Xinjiang, where an estimated 1.5 million Uyghurs and other ethnic minorities have disappeared into concentration camps.UESTC has close relationships with the Chinese defence industry. The university operates a national laboratory on high-power radiation with the Chinese Academy of Engineering Physics, the PRC\u2019s primary nuclear warhead research complex. CETC, a state-owned defence conglomerate, partnered jointly with the MOE to developUESTC\u2019s capabilities. Under the arrangement, UESTC agreed to expand its collaboration with CETC, help train CETC personnel and send its best students to work at CETC. Defence industry agency SASTIND also signed agreements to supervise UESTC in 2008 and 2016.",

However, the university does not appear on the Ministry of Education\u2019s list of subordinate universities.Individuals formerly and presently affiliated with the university have also held affiliations with the MSS or the MSS-linked think tank the China Institutes of Contemporary International Relations (\u4e2d\u56fd\u73b0\u4ee3\u56fd\u9645\u5173\u7cfb\u7814\u7a76\u9662). They include Geng Huichang (\u803f\u60e0\u660c), a former Minister of State Security (2007-2016) and vice minister of State Security (1998-2007). Prior to this he was the head of\u00a0 China Institutes of Contemporary International Relations from 1992 to 1998. From 1990 to 1992, he was the director of UIR\u2019s American Research Department and from 1985-1990 he was deputy director of the American Research department.\u00a0 Notably, current UIR President Tao Jian is also a former CICIR vice-president and a UIR graduate.UIR gives the MSS a way to work with foreign universities and academics to shape and learn about perceptions of the PRC\u2019s views on security. It also provides a platform for the MSS to identify talent, recruit officers and collect intelligence.The university\u2019s Hangzhou campus, also known as the Zhejiang Second People\u2019s Police School, may carry out more practical training of MSS officers and has been described on a local government website as \u2018specialising in training special talent\u2019. Some graduates of the Hangzhou campus have moved straight into MSS positions. The Hangzhou campus works closely with Zhejiang University on teaching and research.",
